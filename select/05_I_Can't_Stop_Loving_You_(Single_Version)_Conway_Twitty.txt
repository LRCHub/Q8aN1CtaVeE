I can't stop loving you
So I made up my mind
To live in memories of old lonesome time

I can't stop wanting you
It's useless to say
So I'll just live my life in dreams of yesterday

Those happy hours that we once knew
So long ago, still make me blue
And they say that time heals a broken heart
But time has stood still since we'be been apart

I can't stop loving you
So I made up my mind
To live in memory of old lonesome time

I can't stop wanting you
It's useless to say
So I'll just live my life in dreams of yesterday
