Your minutemen don't stand a chance inside mi casa
Even with Viagra, disband, God no, may I say nada?
I used to be naive and dress fresh when I was small
Now, I line these niggas up against the wall and grab they balls

I like to hear the tone of their voice when it's high pitch
It's the only way to separate the mens from the bitch
The loyal from the snitch, I dig a ditch when they twitch
Bring 'em to their knees, no higher than my hem stitch

You trying to verbal me, you bound to end up voice lift
You wanna change your plea but now your ass is choiceless
I illuminate the atmosphere a million watts strong
Before free like BC, your night was weeks long

You can't stop my shine, my state of being's too sublime
Too refined, too significant to be defined
I've got a round and automatic for you mortals out of line
See, I'm your worst nightmare, I'm striking in the daytime, what?

You can't stop the shining
You wanna stop the shining?
Can't stop the shining
You can't stop the shining

Hey yo, my subject matters travels in three different states
Gas, liquid, solid, decelerate your heart rate
I duplicate the sound god makes when he farts in space
Make you say Them cats say I'm wicked, the way I just kick it
The man for the 150, too scientific for you to come and get it
Won't you just quit it? Stop all the gimmick, bust it
Hey yo, peep it, suck the blood out of you, diagnose you an anemic

Hundred miles runnin', hundred shots gunnin'
Ha, I just got your catch, yeah, you can keep runnin'
The impact of the rush will leave you decapitated
None reinstated, your style's been deflated
You won't quite make it, dirty cash just invaded, yeah

I know you prayed for my downfall
Curse all you cats whose down with Babylon
You Babylon, I'll battle you unto the break of dawn
Or better yet, 'til we can identify flying aliens

Well, I'll be smooth sailing, all you chameleons
Mortal beings, what? Pure earthlings, yeah
Traveling through the bowels of Brooklyn blood as a halogen
Standing on Flatbush, hollering with my hooligans
Unify my styles like the Russian and the I'm platinum plus and you're silver still and

You can't stop the shining
You wanna stop the shining?
Can't stop the shining
You can't stop the shining

Yo, my power to weight ratio makes it capable
For me to carry hundred thousand pound boast radios
Fuckin' with the 'Can-I', is like
Stepping on a live land mine behind enemy lines

Military paratroops with camouflage parachutes
In flight suits and boots landing on your roof
Eliminate the target is the prime objective
I create psychic walls harder than cement is

Nobody enters, nobody exits
I wreck shit with methods, electric like the Pentagon's fences
MC's with the hype-nitis disease are
Like crack fiends with the hepatitis B vaccine

Navy Seal team make a bitch scream
Make 'em suck a dick dipped in vaginal cream
'Cause you mothafuckas ain't worth the earth that you walk on
You ain't worth the paper plates prisoners eat pork on, mothafuckas
Rip Rock part two, yeah, so what the fuck you wanna do?

You can't stop the shining
You wanna stop the shining?
Can't stop the shining
You can't stop the shining
